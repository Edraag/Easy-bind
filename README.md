# Easy-bind

Easy-bind is a collection of macros that make the binding of local variables, functions and macros 
in Common Lisp more convenient. It adopts the "paren-free" equational syntax for binding local 
variables from the loop facility, and generalizes it to a simple domain-specific language for local 
binding. It provides a facility for easily defining new binding forms that use a similar paren-
reduced syntax.

Dependencies: none.
Should work with any ANSI-compliant Common Lisp. Tested with SBCL, CMUCL, ECL and Clisp.
